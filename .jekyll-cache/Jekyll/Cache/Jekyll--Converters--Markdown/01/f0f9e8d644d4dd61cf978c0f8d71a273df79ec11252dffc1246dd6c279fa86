We use Nginx in both reverse proxy and load balancer topologies across all of our customer facing and internal services. We created this role to ease out and standardize the Nginx setup process. You can use ansible-galaxy to install this role in your project. It is currently tested on Ubuntu Xenial and requires ansible 2.2+
